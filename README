= Import Export

Supports a more enhanced version of exporting your Radiant database, and 
adds the ability to import the results of an export operation.

This extension will export the schema_migrations table, meaning future 
extension migrations are seamless

Updated to use db/data.yml, following what yaml_db does

To import use: 

 $ rake db:import

To export, browse to /admin/export or use:

 $ rake db:export
